## Components

### VGG16 Implementation
- `main.py` contains the core VGG16 architecture implementation
- Features block method for organizing convolutional layers
- Implements the standard VGG16 architecture with appropriate layer configurations

### Image Processing
- `frog.py` provides functionality to download images from URLs
- Supports direct image downloads for testing and evaluation purposes

### Model Evaluation
- `test.py` includes testing utilities for model evaluation
- Provides classification scores and predictions
- Supports model performance analysis

### Notebooks
- `VGG16-layerwise.ipynb`: Detailed implementation and explanation of VGG16 layers
- `neural_basics.ipynb`: Foundation concepts of neural networks (located in root directory)

### Model Files
- Pre-trained weights stored in `.pth` format
- Ready for inference and further training

## Usage

1. **Download Images**:
```python
python frog.py
```

2. **Run Model Evaluation**:
